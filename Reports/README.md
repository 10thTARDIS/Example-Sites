Reports
============================

Cascade Server provides reports out of the box to help with your content management and freshness.

The Broken Link Report dashboard tab contains a report of all broken links in a particular Site. On this tab, users can see each broken link and the assets in which the broken link is contained. Broken links can be marked as fixed and then filtered out so that only links that still need to be addressed are displayed.

The Stale Content Report dashboard includes a graphical summary of content needing review and a table view of each stale item. The Stale Content tab contains several actions to help manage stale content, including sending notifications and scheduling future review dates.

Cascade Server also connects with Google Analytics via a Connector to import analytics data into your instance for graphical and tabular views that can be filtered based on differen time intervals.

Other content and asset reports can be created using data that Cascade Server gneerates. Such reports include:

Pages without a Title or Display Name metadata value
Pages without a Review Date medadata value
Recently created Pages
Recently edited Pages
Recently published Pages
Pages with unpublished changes
Pages not set to publish

These reports are created using either XSLT or Velocity by indexing assets within the application and displaying those that meet the criteria. Additional reports can be created and these reports are open to repurposing as needed.

Current Site was exported using Cascade Server version 7.12.4
