Blog
============================

This example contains Formats (in both Velocity and XSLT), example Javascript code, and example Web Services code (in PHP) for editing Block assets in Cascade to capture information from a live website and store it in Cascade Server.

It contains:

* Landing Page for aggregation of all recent posts.
* Taxonomy Pages for 7 pre-built Categories.
* Folders for yearly and monthly organization of Blog Posts.
* Examples for both Javascript-driven and Web Services comment functionality.

*To utilize web services instead of Javascript (via Disqus), edit the "Blog Post" Configuration Set and the "Page Comments" region. Switch the block to `/_cascade/blocks/index/comments` and pair it with the `/_cascade/formats/post-comments` Format.*
